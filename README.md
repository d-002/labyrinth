# labyrinth
Doom-like labyrinth with randomly generated levels. School project.

### Trailer
*coming soon*

### Overview
This is a Python game where you try to find the exit gate to a maze and go to the next level, where a bigger maze will be waiting for you. But beware, evil monsters will try and stop you from doing so!

There is an infinite amount of levels, generated by an algorithm coded for a school project. The main file you will need to run is `Labyrinth.pyw`. It will require you to install the required modules: `pip install requirements.txt`.  
You can also find two other python files: `entities.py` (entities handling) and `laby.py` (labyrinth generation).  
The remaining python files were used in the development process in order to resize images. You don't need them.

### Controls
Pan with the mouse, ZQSD to move (sorry), left click to attack and right click to open doors.

WASD will be available soon!
